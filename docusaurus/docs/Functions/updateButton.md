#updateButton()

This function will update the button related variables: [buttonPressed](buttonPressed), [buttonDown](buttonDown), [buttonReleased](buttonReleased) and [buttonHold](buttonHold).

It is recommendable to call this function once every loop, otherwise these variables may not work as expected.

This function is called automatically if you use [update()](update).
