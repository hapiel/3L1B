#What is TLOB

TLOB stands for Three Leds One Button, aka 3L1B, and is an Arduino library.

With this library it becomes easier to write arduino code for games and toys that involve 3 leds and 1 button. You can download the library on [github](https://github.com/hapiel/TLOB).

Starting a library name with a number is unpractical, hence the name TLOB.
